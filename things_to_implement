1. Current code to examine coding mutations does not consider splicing mutations. Modify code to output all possible splicing mutations for a gene. 

2. For each transcript of a gene, calculate the expected mutation rate of silent mutations, missense mutations and stopgain mutations across the entire gene using the per-base mutation probabilities. Similarly, calculate the observed number of rare silent mutations, missense mutations and stopgain mutations using the Exome VCF file (frequency < 0.001). Compare the count of silent vs missense mutations using the expected rates. Determine if the observed number of missense (stopgain/splicing) mutations is significantly lower than expected. 

3. Frameshift mutations result in a complete change of the amino acid sequence and a new stop codon downstream. In some cases, this can result in a completely new amino acid sequence at the tail end of a gene. Frameshift mutations in combination with alternative splicing can result in new transcripts that can lead to disease. As a result, the impact of frameshift mutations can be different from that of stopgain mutations. See e.g. this paper http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/23/3055.full.pdf 

Our goal is to analyze the coding sequence of each gene to identify locations in the gene where a frameshift mutation in combination with alternative splicing can result in a functional transcript that is not impacted by non-sense mediated decay.
